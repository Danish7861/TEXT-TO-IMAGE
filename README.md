# Text-to-Image Generation using Diffusers

![Header Image](text_to_image.png)

## Introduction

This repository showcases a fascinating project in the field of artificial intelligence: **Text-to-Image Generation using Diffusers**. With the help of the Diffusers library, we've harnessed the power of AI to transform text prompts into stunning visual imagery. This project demonstrates the incredible potential of AI in bridging the gap between textual cues and vivid images.

## Project Highlights

- Leverage the Diffusers library to generate images from textual prompts.
- Utilize Python libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library) and Matplotlib for image handling and visualization.
- Incorporate a pre-trained model ("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4") for efficient image generation.
- Seamlessly integrate GPU acceleration to enhance processing speed.
- Capture the AI-generated images and save them in various formats.
- Display the generated images using Matplotlib for visual inspection.
